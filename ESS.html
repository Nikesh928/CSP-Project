            <h2>What is the role of ESS?</h2>
            <p>Environmental Systems and Societies (ESS) plays a critical role in understanding the sustainability of dairy farming through the comparison of protein content in manure and milk. The subject helps assess food production efficiency, waste management, and environmental impacts</p>

                    <li><strong>Food Production Efficiency:</strong> Measuring feed-to-milk conversion to optimize resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pollution and waste management:</strong> Addressing nitrogen runoff, soil contamination, and air pollution from manure.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>Efficiency of Protein Utilization in Livestock</strong></h3>
                    - Examines how protein-rich cattle feed is converted into milk vs. manure.<br>
                    - Helps assess feed efficiencyâ€”a lower protein percentage in manure indicates better nutrient absorption and sustainable farming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>Sustainable Livestock Management</strong></h3>
                    - Explores the environmental consequences of overfeeding proteins (e.g., nitrogen contamination in soil and water).<br>
                    - Helps design better feeding strategies that optimize milk production while reducing waste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>Impact on Agricultural Waste Management</strong></h3>
                    - Analyze how manure protein content affects water pollution, air pollution, and soil contamination.<br>
                    - Suggests solutions like composting, biogas production, and nutrient recycling to minimize environmental harm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>Circular Economy in Agriculture</strong></h3>
                    - Examines how manure can be processed into natural fertilizers or bio-based feed additives, reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.<br>
                    - Promotes waste-to-resource strategies that enhance sustainability.
