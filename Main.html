                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The quality and composition of cattle feed play a crucial role in determining the 
                    <span class="highlight">nutritional value, yield, and sustainability</span> of dairy production. 
                    Organic cattle feed has gained prominence due to its potential benefits for 
                    <span class="highlight">animal health and milk quality</span>. This study explores how different nutrient components in cattle feed 
                    impact the yield and composition of milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Research Question:</strong> <br>
                    What is the relationship between the <span class="highlight">nutrient content</span> of organic cattle feed and <span class="highlight">milk yield and quality</span> in dairy farming?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding this relationship can help dairy farmers optimize feeding strategies, 
                    improve milk production efficiency, and contribute to <span class="highlight">sustainable agriculture</span>. 
                    Additionally, consumers benefit from <span class="highlight">higher-quality milk</span> with enhanced nutritional value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Research Approach:</strong> <br>
                    This research involves analyzing cattle feed composition, tracking milk yield, 
                    and assessing nutritional changes based on diet variations. 
                    The study considers key nutrients such as <span class="highlight">protein, fat, fiber, and minerals</span> 
                    to evaluate their influence on milk production and quality.
